      <description>Definitions a.) InferenceGive a definition of inference in the logical sense. Include some examples of inferences, as well as non-examples, explaining why the definition applies to the examples.&#xA;b.) ValidityGive a definition of deductive and inductive validity. For both, include some examples of valid and invalid inferences, again explaining why the definition applies.&#xA;Hint: A definition needs to fully explain the meaning of a concept. This is typically done by saying under which precise conditions the concept applies.</description>

      <description>Inferences Which of the following is an inference?&#xA;If you do that, my head will explode. I mean it&amp;rsquo;s logical to think that AI will want to exterminate humans. We&amp;rsquo;ve tried for years to build a working AGI and despite all the compute and efforts, we haven&amp;rsquo;t managed. So, we won&amp;rsquo;t build an AGI anytime soon.

      <description>Logic and AI In this chapter, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about what logic is and what it has to do with AI.&#xA;First, you&amp;rsquo;ll make acquaintance with some basic concepts of logical theory:&#xA;inference validity, and logical systems. Then, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about three ways in which logic is relevant for AI:&#xA;foundationally, methodologically, and instrumentally. What is logic? On the most general level, logic is the study of valid inference. To understand this definition better, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss inferences and validity in turn.</description>
