      <description>Definitions a.) InferenceGive a definition of inference in the logical sense. Include some examples of inferences, as well as non-examples, explaining why the definition applies to the examples.
b.) ValidityGive a definition of deductive and inductive validity. For both, include some examples of valid and invalid inferences, again explaining why the definition applies.
Hint: A definition needs to fully explain the meaning of a concept. This is typically done by saying under which precise conditions the concept applies.</description>
